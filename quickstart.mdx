## Get up and running with the Tripvento API

### 1. Get your API key

Head to [tripvento.com/pricing](https://tripvento.com/pricing) and pick a plan. Sandbox is free — no credit card required. Your key is delivered instantly on checkout.

### 2. Make your first request

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual key:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.tripvento.com/api/v1/destinations/" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" | python3 -m json.tool
```

You should see a list of available cities with hotel counts.

### 3. Get rankings for a city

Fetch the top hotels for a specific travel intent:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.tripvento.com/api/v1/rankings/?city=Miami&intent_name=romantic" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" | python3 -m json.tool
```

Each hotel comes with:

- **Final score** — overall match rating (0–100)
- **Geo score** — proximity to relevant POIs
- **AI score** — semantic match to the travel intent
- **Sentiment score** — guest review analysis
- **Score components** — detailed breakdown including nearby POIs, guest signals, and AI reasoning

### 4. Get the full city matrix

One request to get all hotels with all intent scores for a city:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.tripvento.com/api/v1/city-matrix/?city=Miami" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" | python3 -m json.tool
```

This returns every hotel in the city with scores across all 14 travel intents — perfect for building comparison UIs or powering search filters.

### 5. Check your usage

Monitor your quota anytime:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.tripvento.com/api/v1/usage/" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" | python3 -m json.tool
```

Returns your tier, monthly limit, current usage, and reset date. This call does not count toward your quota.

## Authentication

Every request requires your API key in the `X-Api-Key` header:

```
X-Api-Key: tv_your_key_here
```

Requests without a valid key return `403 Forbidden`.

## Rate limits

Every response includes rate limit headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000
X-RateLimit-Used: 42
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4958
```

If you exceed your monthly quota, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with your usage stats and reset date.

## Caching

All ranking data is cacheable for up to 24 hours. Rankings are recalculated daily, so there's no benefit to fetching more frequently. Cache aggressively — it's the best way to maximize your quota.
