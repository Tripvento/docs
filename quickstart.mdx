## Get started in four steps

Grab your API key, make your first request, and explore hotel rankings by travel intent.

### Step 1 — Get your API key

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Create an account and get your key">
    1. Sign up at [tripvento.com](https://tripvento.com).
    2. Navigate to **Settings → API Keys** in your dashboard.
    3. Click **Create Key** and copy the value — you won't see it again.

    <Tip>Store your key in an environment variable: `export TRIPVENTO_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"`</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2 — Verify your key

```bash
curl -s "https://api.tripvento.com/api/v1/destinations/" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" | python3 -m json.tool
```

You should see a JSON list of available destinations. If you get a `401`, double-check your key.

### Step 3 — Get rankings for a destination

Request the top-ranked hotels for a specific destination and travel intent:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.tripvento.com/api/v1/rankings/?destination=miami_fl&intent=romantic" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" | python3 -m json.tool
```

The response returns hotels ranked by how well they match the selected intent for that destination.

### Step 4 — Get the full destination matrix

See every intent score for a single destination at once:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.tripvento.com/api/v1/city-matrix/?destination=miami_fl" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" | python3 -m json.tool
```

The matrix gives you a complete picture of how all hotels in a destination perform across every intent.

## Caching

All ranking data is cacheable for up to 24 hours. Rankings are recalculated monthly,
so there's no benefit to fetching more frequently.
