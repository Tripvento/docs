Every request requires your API key in the `X-Api-Key` header. Requests without a valid key return `403 Forbidden`.

```http
X-Api-Key: tv_your_key_here
```

## Getting your API key

Head to [tripvento.com/pricing](https://tripvento.com/pricing) and pick a plan. Sandbox is free — no credit card required. Your key is delivered instantly.

## Using the key

Include the `X-Api-Key` header in every request:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.tripvento.com/api/v1/destinations/" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secret. Do not expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>
