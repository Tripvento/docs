Tripvento ranks hotels based on **travel intents** — the reason behind a trip. Each intent captures a distinct set of preferences and priorities, so rankings shift depending on what matters most to the traveler.

## Available intents

| `family`       | Family-friendly properties with kids' amenities          |

## Using intents with the API

### Get rankings for a single intent

Pass the `intent` parameter to `/rankings/` along with a destination:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.tripvento.com/api/v1/rankings/?destination=miami_fl&intent=romantic" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

This returns hotels ranked by how well they match the `romantic` intent in Miami.

### Get all intents for a destination

Use the `/city-matrix/` endpoint to see how every hotel scores across all intents at once:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.tripvento.com/api/v1/city-matrix/?destination=miami_fl" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

The matrix response includes a score for every intent on each hotel, making it easy to compare across trip types.

## How intents work

Each intent is powered by a composite scoring model that combines:

- **Review analysis** — sentiment and keyword extraction from guest reviews
- **Amenity matching** — property features mapped to intent relevance
- **Location signals** — proximity to relevant points of interest
- **Guest feedback patterns** — recurring themes from verified stays

Scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score means the hotel is a stronger match for that intent.
