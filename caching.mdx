You may cache responses for up to 24 hours as per our [Terms of Service](https://tripvento.com/terms). Cache aggressively — it's the best way to maximize your quota.

## Response headers

Every response includes these headers:

| Header | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `X-Response-Time-Ms` | Server-side processing time in milliseconds |
| `X-Cache-Status` | `HIT` if served from server cache, `MISS` if freshly computed |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Your monthly request limit |
| `X-RateLimit-Used` | Requests used this month |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining this month |
| `Cache-Control` | CDN/client caching directive — see per-endpoint rules below |

### Example

```http
X-Response-Time-Ms: 45
X-Cache-Status: HIT
X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000
X-RateLimit-Used: 128
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4872
Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400, stale-while-revalidate=3600
```

## Cache-Control per endpoint

| Endpoint | Cache-Control |
| -------- | ------------- |
| `/rankings/` | `public, max-age=86400, stale-while-revalidate=3600` |
| `/city-matrix/` | `public, max-age=86400, stale-while-revalidate=3600` |
| `/destinations/` | `public, max-age=86400, stale-while-revalidate=3600` |
| `/usage/` | `private, no-cache` |

## How it works

- **`max-age=86400`** — safe to cache for 24 hours. Rankings are recalculated daily so there's no benefit to fetching more frequently.
- **`stale-while-revalidate=3600`** — your CDN or client can serve stale content for up to 1 hour while revalidating in the background. Zero-latency updates for end users.
- **`X-Cache-Status: HIT`** — indicates the response was served from the server-side cache (Redis). Combined with CDN caching in front of the API, HIT responses are typically sub-10ms.
