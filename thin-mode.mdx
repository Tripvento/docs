title: "Thin Mode"
description: "Reduce payload sizes with thin mode for faster API responses"
---

Add `?thin=true` to `/rankings/` or `/city-matrix/` to get significantly smaller payloads. City-matrix is thin by default.

## Payload comparison

| Mode | Size | Includes |
| ---- | ---- | -------- |
| **Fat response** | ~466 KB | Full hotel details — story, amenities, nearby POIs, images, price, ratings |
| **Thin response** | ~88 KB | Just `id`, `name`, `location`, `detail_url` alongside all scores |

Thin responses include `detail_url` for every hotel and intent, so you can fetch full details on demand when a user selects a specific result.

## Examples

### Rankings — thin mode

```bash
curl -s "https://api.tripvento.com/api/v1/rankings/?destination=miami_fl&intent=romantic&thin=true" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### City matrix — thin by default, full opt-in

```bash
curl -s "https://api.tripvento.com/api/v1/city-matrix/?destination=miami_fl&thin=false" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## When to use thin mode

- **List views** — show hotel names and scores, fetch details on click
- **Mobile clients** — reduce bandwidth and parse time
- **Pre-caching** — store scores for an entire city, load details lazily
- **MCP/AI integrations** — keep context windows lean

Use `detail_url` on each hotel or intent to drill down into the full response when needed.
